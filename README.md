# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this assignment is to visualizes the ride-sharing data over a period of time for each city type. We needed to understand how many cities the company services, how many drivers are in each city, the number of rides given and how much fare was collected for the rides. Once this information is understood, we need to show the relation of these variables between the city types. (Rural, Suburban, Urban). For the challenge a new summary data frame is created with the ride-sharing data to show the fares collected in a 4-month period and to see what the trends are between Rural, Suburban and Urban cities.

## Results
After running the analysis, I uncovered that there was a total of 2,375 rides given.  Pyber ridesharing offered services in 66 Urban, 36 Suburban and 18 Rural cities.  Based on the chart below, it's easy to see how much each city type generated in fares collect for the company. Rides in Urban cities generated the most fares while the rural cities generated the least in the 4-month window that was measured.  It's easy to see from the data collected, that Urban cities will produce more in fares due to population density and that there are more Urban cities than there are rural.  Rural cities did collect higher fare amounts per ride. However, because there are far fewer rides provided in rural cities, they still bring in the least amount in fares collected.  While Urban cities collect a little less fare per ride, they make it up in volume of rides serviced. Suburban cities fall right in the middle of it all.

## Summary
Besides population density to think about for the city types, another consideration would be the number of destinations that people want to visit within their areas that they would need rides to.  Obviously urban cities will offer the most destinations that people will want to visit, while Suburban and rural will have less in their respective areas.  Pyber should consider creating promotions in lower population areas, to entice people to use the services more to go to areas that offer more destinations / locations worth visiting.  In addition, since Urban and Suburban areas have higher volume in ride requests, they can incrementally increase the fare amounts for those areas, while decreasing the amounts for the rural areas hopefully getting more people in less populated areas to use the service.
